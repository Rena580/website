  <h2>About Rena Case</h2>

  <p>This is my website about a Safety Plan for First Nation Womens.  I am Chilcotin (Tsilhqot'in),from Redstone (TsiDeldel) is located 188 km West of Williams Lake, along Highway 20. Tsilhqot'in consists of six bands which are  Tl'etinqox (Anaham), Tŝi Deldel (Redstone), Yuneŝit'in Government (Stone), Xeni Gwet'in First Nations Government (Nemiah), ʔEsdilagh (Alexandria) and Tl'esqox (Toosey). I come from a big family, 4 brothers and 3 sisters and numerous neices and nephews.  I am the first one to graduate highschool and the first one to graduate with a Bachelors degree, a major in First Nations, with a minor in Anthropology.  I am staying in Surrey now, and I am loving it here because I have my own place, a job, and a boyfriend.  I will be going back to my job after this course.  I wanted to create this website for all First Womens Safety Plan becuase this day in age we have the murder and missing women, <strong>this makes me sad</strong>.

    <p> Murdered and Missing Women
    <ul>
      <li>The missing and murdered Indigenous women epidemic affects Indigenous peoples in Canada and the United States, including the First Nations, Inuit, Métis, and Native American communities. It has been described as a Canadian national crisis and a Canadian genocide. Wikipedia</li>
      <li> CBC News has looked into 34 cases across Canada which involve the death or disappearance of Indigenous women, but which authorities say were not due to foul play.

In every case, families of the women say they do not accept the findings of police. They suggest murder may be involved.

CBC News found evidence in many of the cases that points to suspicious circumstances, unexplained bruises and other factors that suggest further investigation is warranted.

Many advocates for missing and murdered Indigenous women say these are exactly the kinds of cases requiring further scrutiny in a national inquiry.

We have created a profile for each person. You can view each one by choosing the profile in the bar above.

This project is part of CBC's ongoing investigation into missing and murdered Indigenous women. We continue to expand our database of all unsolved cases. To search more than 250 of those cases, use the Case Explorer below.</li>
