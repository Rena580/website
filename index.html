  <h2>About Rena Case</h2>

  <p>This is my website about a Safety Plan for First Nation Womens.  I am Chilcotin (Tsilhqot'in),from Redstone (TsiDeldel) is located 188 km West of Williams Lake, along Highway 20. Tsilhqot'in consists of six bands which are  Tl'etinqox (Anaham), Tŝi Deldel (Redstone), Yuneŝit'in Government (Stone), Xeni Gwet'in First Nations Government (Nemiah), ʔEsdilagh (Alexandria) and Tl'esqox (Toosey). I come from a big family, 4 brothers and 3 sisters and numerous neices and nephews.  I am the first one to graduate highschool and the first one to graduate with a Bachelors degree, a major in First Nations, with a minor in Anthropology.  I am staying in Surrey now, and I am loving it here because I have my own place, a job, and a boyfriend.  I will be going back to my job after this course.  I wanted to create this website for all First Womens Safety Plan becuase this day in age we have the murder and missing women, <strong>this makes me sad</strong>.
